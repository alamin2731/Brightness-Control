# Brightness Control Program

The Brightness Control Program is a simple Python application that allows you to control the brightness level of your device's display. It provides an interactive GUI where you can increase or decrease the brightness using buttons or keyboard shortcuts. Additionally, you can set a custom brightness level using a slider.

## Features

- Increase and decrease the brightness level of your device's display.
- Set a custom brightness level using a slider.
- Real-time updates of the brightness level and live preview.
- Keyboard shortcuts for adjusting the brightness.
- User-friendly and visually appealing GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (should be available by default with Python)
- `wmi` library (install using `pip install wmi`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install the required libraries (`wmi`) using `pip`.
3. Run the `brightness_control.py` file using Python.
4. The GUI window will open, allowing you to control the brightness using the provided options.
5. Use the "Increase Brightness" and "Decrease Brightness" buttons to adjust the brightness level.
6. Alternatively, you can use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard as shortcuts for increasing and decreasing the brightness.
7. Drag the slider to set a custom brightness level, and the brightness will be adjusted accordingly.
